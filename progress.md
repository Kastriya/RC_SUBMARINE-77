# 🔱 Project: RC Submarine – HackClub Grant Submission

## 🚀 About the Project

This is a low-cost, open-source **RC Submarine** designed for exploration, robotics learning, and STEM showcase. The goal is to develop an affordable, waterproof, and fully controllable submarine for educational use and underwater robotics experimentation.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Build a fully functional RC submarine under $200.
- Integrate camera, sensors, and wireless control.
- Waterproof electronics using DIY enclosures.
- Make STL parts open-source and modular.
