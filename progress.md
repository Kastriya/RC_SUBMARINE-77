#  Project: RC Submarine â€“ HackClub Grant Submission

##  About the Project

This is a low-cost, open-source **RC Submarine** designed for exploration, robotics learning, and STEM showcase. The goal is to develop an affordable, waterproof, and fully controllable submarine for educational use and underwater robotics experimentation.

---

##  Objectives

- Build a fully functional RC submarine under $200.
- Integrate camera, sensors, and wireless control.
- Waterproof electronics using DIY enclosures.
- Make STL parts open-source and modular.

##  6-Day Build Log

###  Day 1: Research & Sketching  
- Researched torpedo-style and modular submarines  
- Studied ballast systems, waterproofing, and RC controls  
- Sketched a hybrid hull + electronics chamber model

---

###  Day 2: Hull Design + Material Planning  
- Designed initial cylindrical hull with round edges  
- Planned PLA waterproof printing & internal compartments  
- Finalized OpenSCAD STL scripting plan

---

###  Day 3: Electronics BOM Planning  
- Selected core components: ESC, Brushless motor, RX-TX  
- Focused on LiPo safety and compact wiring  
- Added LEDs and camera slot ideas

---

###  Day 4: CAD + 3D Modelling  
- Designed the hull and rear propeller shaft system  
- Modeled front dome and rear control fin slots  
- Prepped STL export files for printing

---

###  Day 5: Budgeting & Grant Justification  
- Created BOM in USD under $200  
- Wrote README and justification for HackClub grant  
- Focused on modular design for future upgrades

---

###  Day 6: Documentation and Final Touches  
- Finalized GitHub README  
- Added diagrams and wiring overview  
- Cleaned STL files and exported for print test
