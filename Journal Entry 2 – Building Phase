What I did: Built the hull using PVC, installed the motor, propeller, and rudder. Set up the servos and control linkages. Started wiring the receiver and ESC.

What I learned: Learned how to seal bulkheads properly and route waterproof cables. Discovered that O-rings and silicone grease are critical to prevent leaks.

Challenges: Servo rod sealing and space management inside the tube.
