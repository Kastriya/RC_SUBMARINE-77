What I did: Researched how RC submarines work, different propulsion systems, and control methods. Decided to use a 77 cm PVC tube as the main hull and a pump-based ballast system for diving.

What I learned: Learned about buoyancy, waterproofing electronics, and how submarines balance weight and volume.

Challenges: Finding affordable waterproof components and understanding ballast control.
