What I did: Tested the submarine in shallow water. Adjusted buoyancy with foam and ballast weights. The ballast pump worked to make it dive and surface.

What I learned: Learned about trimming, stability, and fine-tuning ESC calibration. Understood how pressure affects seals underwater.

Challenges: Maintaining straight motion underwater; motor needed better waterproofing.
