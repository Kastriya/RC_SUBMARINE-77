This project aims to build a compact, WiFi-controlled submarine equipped with an ESP32-CAM for live First-Person View (FPV) streaming. It uses brushless waterproof motors for propulsion and servo-controlled fins for steering. The submarine will also log environmental data such as water temperature, depth (via pressure sensor), and motion (via IMU) to an onboard SD card for analysis.

The system is wireless but includes a tether fallback for power or control in case of signal loss. Designed with an acrylic waterproof body, custom 3D-printed parts, and epoxy-sealed electronics, the sub can perform basic underwater maneuvers and real-time monitoring.

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Deserves a Grant:
ðŸ”¥ "We're not just building a robot â€” we're opening the deep waters to young minds who otherwise never imagined being marine innovators. One project. One submarine. A whole new world unlocked."

ðŸš€ With your grant, I will turn this submarine into a replicable open-source project â€” complete with STL files, code, assembly guides, and documentation â€” allowing anyone, anywhere in the world to build their own underwater explorer.
